# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2020-05-23

**Today's Progress**: I have always wanted to play around with real-time communications using sockets with Node API, Vue or React frontend and a multi-user/multi-channel chat system seems to be an interesting application to be built using this stack. Another idea is to hook the app to be used as a handoff/handover platform for chatbots. I have already started with some HTML/CSS foundations for the template like a month ago and so today I'm going to start with the frontend implementaion of the app. 

**Thoughts:** Getting myself soaked in Node and Vue again :)
